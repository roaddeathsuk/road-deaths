    https://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/news/2024/11/witness-appeal-after-fatal-collision-in-keynsham/: "We\u2019re appealing for witnesses after a man died in a collision on the A4 Bath Road in Keynsham this morning (25 November).\n\nShortly before 8.30am, between the Hicks Gate and Broadmead roundabouts, a lorry and a motorcycle collided.\n\nThe motorcyclist, a 33-year-old man, suffered serious injuries. Sadly, despite the best efforts of paramedics, he died at the scene. Our thoughts are with his family and they are being supported by a specially trained officer.\n\nThe road was closed in both directions between the two roundabouts to allow collision investigators to examine the area but has since reopened.\n\nIf you witnessed the collision or have any dashcam footage, or information, which could help our investigation, please call 101 and give the call handler the reference number 5224310078."

  comment: A motorist killed a six-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing after driving through a red traffic light, a jury heard. She failed to see the red traffic light and drove into the girl. Her driving fell well below the standard expected and, as a result, the child died. Andjele Vranjes, was found not guilty of causing death by careless driving.

  comment: "Ms Ouhoud had alighted a bus at a stop on St Margaret\u2019s Road and was walking away at the junction of Sandycoombe Road when she was struck by the car.  Witnesses described the Audi driving at a reasonable, slow speed before accelerating and mounting the curb in the tragic accident.  \"His driving did not fall below safety standards. He has suffered an unexpected medical episode which has resulted in collision with Ms Ouhoud which has proven fatal.\""
