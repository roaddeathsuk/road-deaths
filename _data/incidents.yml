  comment: A motorist killed a six-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing after driving
    through a red traffic light, a jury heard. She failed to see the red traffic light
    and drove into the girl. Her driving fell well below the standard expected and,
    as a result, the child died. Andjele Vranjes, was found not guilty of causing
    death by careless driving.
